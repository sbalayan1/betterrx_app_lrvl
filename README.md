<h1>Create an application that searches the npi registry and lists the results.</h1>
    <h2>User Interface Requirements</h2>
        <p>user should be able to search by first name, last name, npi number, taxonomy description, city, state and zip.</p>
        <p>50 results or less should be displayed by default.</p>
        <p>If more than 50 results are available, a mechanism to load more results or paging should be implemented.</p>
        <p>The application will not be required to display more than 1200 results from any given search.</p>
        <p>If a user clicks on a record, more information about the provider should be displayed.</p>
        <p>Additional information can be formatted manually or the following url can be leveraged https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/provider-view/{npi}</p>
        <p>A user should be able to return to the search results easily after viewing a providerâ€™s details, thus a modal or a back button should be implemented.</p>
    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
        <p>Bonus for Laravel backend, but can use whatever language you are comfortable with. </p>
        <p>Must use a Javascript framework for the frontend (Angular, React, VueJs,  Livewire/Alpine) </p>
        <p>API requests should be sent from the backend </p>
        <p>API Docs: https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api-page </p>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <p>Link to git repo.  Please also include a video demonstrating functionality if Laravel is not used.
