<h1>Create an application that searches the npi registry and lists the results.</h1>
    <h2>User Interface Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>user should be able to search by first name, last name, npi number, taxonomy description, city, state and zip.</li>
            <li>50 results or less should be displayed by default.</li>
            <li>If more than 50 results are available, a mechanism to load more results or paging should be implemented.</li>
            <li>The application will not be required to display more than 1200 results from any given search.</li>
            <li>If a user clicks on a record, more information about the provider should be displayed.</li>
            <li>Additional information can be formatted manually or the following url can be leveraged https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/provider-view/{npi}.</li>
            <li>A user should be able to return to the search results easily after viewing a providerâ€™s details, thus a modal or a back button should be implemented.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bonus for Laravel backend, but can use whatever language you are comfortable with. </li>
            <li>Must use a Javascript framework for the frontend (Angular, React, VueJs,  Livewire/Alpine). </li>
            <li>API requests should be sent from the backend. </li>
            <li>API Docs: https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/api-page </li>
        </ol>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Link to git repo.  Please also include a video demonstrating functionality if Laravel is not used.</li>
        </ol>
